france though march on to the quarter finals and remain on course to become the first team to successfully defend the world cup since brazil years ago france were overwhelming favourites against a poland side who had limped through the group stage but the memory of their exit from euro served as a warning france had been up and cruising in that last tie against switzerland only to concede two
